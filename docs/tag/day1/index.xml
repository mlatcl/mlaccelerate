      <title>AI for scientific discovery: an introduction to Accelerate Science</title>
      <link>https://mlatcl.github.io/mlaccelerate/talk/jessica/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has the potential to become an engine for scientific discovery across disciplines – from predicting the impact of climate change, to using genetic data to create new healthcare treatments, and from finding new astronomical phenomena to identifying new materials here on Earth. Achieving this potential requires interdisciplinary collaborations that combine scientific insights with expertise in machine learning methods, creating machine learning systems that can be applied to ‘real-world’ problems. The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery is a new initiative from Cambridge University’s Department of Computer Science and Technology, which will support researchers across the University to use machine learning to advance their research. This talk will introduce the thinking behind the Programme and its work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Machine Intelligence?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With breakthroughs in understanding images, translating language, transcribing speech artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise the technological landscape. Machine learning algorithms are able to convert unstructured data into actionable knowledge. With the increasing impact of these technologies, society’s interest is also growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word intelligence conjures notions of human-like capabilities. But are we really on the cusp of creating machines that match us? We associate intelligence with knowledge, but in this talk I will argue that the true marvel of our intelligence is the way it deals with ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the large strides forward we have made, I will argue that we have a long way to go to deliver on the promise of artificial intelligence. And it is a journey that our societies need to take together, not just as computer scientists, but together by rediscovering the interdisciplinary spirit that is required to achieve real scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine Learning and the Scientific Principle</title>
      <link>https://mlatcl.github.io/mlaccelerate/talk/che/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is the science of combining knowledge with data through computation. In this talk we will try to make these concepts mathematically stringent. We will first discuss how we can formulate our knowledge mathematically by building models. Importantly differently from logic machine learning is concerned with knowledge that is uncertain often referred to as beliefs. We will show how we can use probabilities as a mean to quantify our beliefs. In the second part of the talk we will see how we can combine our beliefs with observations and recover an updated belief. We will discuss the interplay between data and beliefs this will become important when choosing which machine learning method to use for different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Role of Uncertainty in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://mlatcl.github.io/mlaccelerate/talk/andreasdamianou/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A machine learning model exploits patterns in the training data to generate an abstraction of the application domain. The knowledge stored inside a model is incomplete, since the model is imperfectly designed and the data fed to it are only a small and possibly biased sample of the full data distribution. Therefore, for many applications it is useful to also quantify the &lt;strong&gt;lack of knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; associated with the model. This can help the training of the model itself but it can also transform predictions into probabilistic expectations which can drive more robust decision making. For example, it is very useful to have uncertainty communicated by a machine learning system which analyses patient data to suggest treatments. In this talk, I will discuss the various sources of uncertainty in a modeling scenario, motivate probabilistic methods for quantifying uncertainty, and explain how uncertainty can be used as an essential part of machine learning-assisted reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
