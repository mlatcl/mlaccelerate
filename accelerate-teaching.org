    :END:

    Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to become an engine for scientific discovery across disciplines – from predicting the impact of climate change, to using genetic data to create new healthcare treatments, and from finding new astronomical phenomena to identifying new materials here on Earth.

    To reach the full promise of this exciting methodology scientists and AI researchers need to work together. Only by creating an interface that stimulate knowledge transfer between AI and the sciences will we be able to exploit the benefits of current technology and importantly provide motivation to direct methodological development in AI from scientific questions.

    With this as motivation we created the *Accelerate Science Winter School* with the aim of bridging the gap between early career researchers in the sciences with AI researchers. The first school will took place Virtually between the =2nd and the 4th of February, 2021=. We hope to arrange further schools in the future.

**** Thursday 4th of February
     The focus on the final day of the winter school will be on machine learning in the context of theoretical physics. The talks will not require knowledge about theoretical physics so in addition to learning about machine learning this day will also give the chance to understand the wonderfully exciting world of modern physics.

     With breakthroughs in understanding images, translating language, transcribing speech artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise the technological landscape. Machine learning algorithms are able to convert unstructured data into actionable knowledge. With the increasing impact of these technologies, society’s interest is also growing.

     The word intelligence conjures notions of human-like capabilities. But are we really on the cusp of creating machines that match us? We associate intelligence with knowledge, but in this talk I will argue that the true marvel of our intelligence is the way it deals with ignorance.

     Despite the large strides forward we have made, I will argue that we have a long way to go to deliver on the promise of artificial intelligence. And it is a journey that our societies need to take together, not just as computer scientists, but together by rediscovering the interdisciplinary spirit that is required to achieve real scientific progress.

     Machine learning is the science of combining knowledge with data through computation. In this talk we will try to make these concepts mathematically stringent. We will first discuss how we can formulate our knowledge mathematically by building models. Importantly differently from logic machine learning is concerned with knowledge that is uncertain often referred to as beliefs. We will show how we can use probabilities as a mean to quantify our beliefs. In the second part of the talk we will see how we can combine our beliefs with observations and recover an updated belief. We will discuss the interplay between data and beliefs this will become important when choosing which machine learning method to use for different scenarios.

     {{< youtube id="o5pxRqkKGtE" >}}
     
     A machine learning model exploits patterns in the training data to generate an abstraction of the application domain. The knowledge stored inside a model is incomplete, since the model is imperfectly designed and the data fed to it are only a small and possibly biased sample of the full data distribution. Therefore, for many applications it is useful to also quantify the *lack of knowledge* associated with the model. This can help the training of the model itself but it can also transform predictions into probabilistic expectations which can drive more robust decision making. For example, it is very useful to have uncertainty communicated by a machine learning system which analyses patient data to suggest treatments. In this talk, I will discuss the various sources of uncertainty in a modeling scenario, motivate probabilistic methods for quantifying uncertainty, and explain how uncertainty can be used as an essential part of machine learning-assisted reasoning.

     Machine learning is a powerful tool to find explanations for data, but not all explanations are created equal. This talk will explore why collaboration with domain experts is critical for the successful application of machine learning in the industrial and scientific domains. We will focus on the expert-driven formulation and evaluation of hierarchical models and show how to specify what should be learned from data and how to apply the scientific principle to gain new and semantic insights.

     Inverse problems arise when we want to use data to extract an insight into the inner workings of a system. Such problems are often ill-posed, meaning that there are multiple explanations compatible with the observations and it is therefore necessary to constrain the problem to arrive at a concrete solution. High-throughput high-resolution genome-wide spatial transcriptomics data is a recent breakthrough technology presenting great promise for gaining insights into cellular interactions and tissue-level systems biology. Extracting biologically useful knowledge from this new data modality comes with a novel set of computational challenges. One such challenge is figuring out how much different cell types have contributed to each spatial point measured from the tissue. We will go step-by-step over a simple, intuitive and interpretable solution (manifested by a matrix factorization) that utilizes expert-annotated reference data of cell types to constrain this ill-posed inverse problem.

     Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. The fundamental particles of QCD, quarks and gluons, carry colour charge and form colourless bound states at low energies. The hadronic bound states of primary interest to us are the mesons and the baryons. From knowledge of the meson spectrum, we use neural networks and Gaussian processes to predict the masses of baryons with 90.3% and 96.6% accuracy, respectively. These results compare favourably to the constituent quark model. We as well predict the masses of pentaquarks and other exotic hadrons.

    I am researching methods for improving the representations learned by machine learning models through the use of uncertainty and information sharing. Uncertainty is needed because real-world data is noisy and our modeling assumptions are imperfect. Complementary, information sharing techniques like transfer learning and multi-view learning allow models to learn from diverse sources. The machine learning tools I am using in my research come from the Bayesian probabilistic or the deep learning domain, but I also investigate methods combining these areas. I have worked in a variety of application areas, such as: multi-modal information fusion, decision making, information retrieval, AI-assisted data science.

    My research focuses on the development of probabilistic machine learning methods for uncertainty quantification and data-efficient sequential decision making. I work on the challenges arising when uncertainty of different types (the loss of precision induced by numerical calculations, data errors, model miss-calibration, etc.) need to be be propagated, controlled and reduced in complex pipelines. I am also interested on how causal inference can be used to leverage decision making methods and to improve the understanding of complex systems and processes. As fields of application of my research I am interested in computational biology, health and environmental sciences.

    String theory is the leading candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. My interests are broad, but focus on bringing string theory into contact with the real world. In particular, motivated by the AdS/CFT correspondence and the principle of holography, I strive to formulate the theory of statistical mechanics that underlies gravitational thermodynamics. Black holes supply an important theoretical laboratory for this research. I want to apply the technology developed in the black hole context to the resolution of spacetime singularities, especially in time dependent, cosmological backgrounds. I aim to understand holography and the emergence of spacetime in general settings. Another major thrust of my research is to explain how the Standard Model of particle physics descends from a fundamental theory. I seek to relate geometrical aspects of the vacuum space of quantum field theories to string theory and use geometric structure as a practical tool for particle phenomenology. Recently, I have been investigating the constraints on string compactifications stemming from cosmology and particle theory inputs. As well, I work on supersymmetric field theories in four dimensions and various problems in mathematical physics.

    His research is at some of the interfaces between string theory, particle physics, cosmology, mathematics, and deep learning. He is particularly interested in the string landscape and its implications for particle physics and cosmology beyond their standard models. These implications often follow from the structure of extra-dimensional geometries, of which there are many possibilities. Halverson’s research therefore requires importing techniques from mathematics and computer science.

    Recently, Halverson’s interest in the interface of physics and deep learning has continued to grow. To that end, he is a co-PI and serves on the institute board of the NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions ([[https://iaifi.org/][ IAIFI]] ) and co-organizes [[http://www.physicsmeetsml.org/][Physics ∩ ML]].

My research focuses on encoding expert knowledge into hierarchical probabilistic models to facilitate inference and specify what to learn from data. Models become more data efficient and more trustworthy if the result of learning is a collection of expert-interpretable components. In my work, I explore how Bayesian non-parametric models can be composed to enforce abstract constraints, yield principled reasoning under uncertainty, and enable scalable and reliable inference.

    I am a Senior Lecturer in the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. The science of machine learning is concerned with how to formulate assumptions into mathematics (modelling) and how to related them to observed data (inference). My research focus spans both these areas, in specific I am interested in how we can specify data efficient and interpretable assumptions that allows us to learn from small amounts of data.
